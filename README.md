# Bitmap_Header-Fonts
This repository contains a library of fonts in bitmap header format for use in AVR or other microcontrollers together with monochrome OLED or LCD Displays, like the SSD1306. 

Different header files are available for character size of 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64 pixels. 
The include files are stored in the bmh_fonts folder, the original ttf font files are found in the ttf_fonts folder. The license of each font is stored with each TTF file. 

The headers currently only support digits and a colon for design of simple number based displays (like a clock or temperature). 

The PDF file contains an overview of the layout of the fonts. 

# The current fonts with free license are available: 

* Ubuntu Fonts
* Liberation2 Fonts
* Indie Flower
* K2D
* Bitstream Vera 

# Used Software
The header files were produced with the python scripts in my git repository "TTF2BMH" and use of bmfont.

# Additional Fonts
Upload of any free (in terms of license) font can be requested, just write a short note here and I will upload as fast as possible.

# Todo
I will work on getting more characters into the font files, when applicable.
