# Bitmap_Header-Fonts
This repository contains a library of fonts in bitmap header format for use in AVR or other microcontrollers together with simple OLED or LCD Displays, like the SSD1306. 

Different header files are available for character size of 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64 pixels. 

The headers currently only support digits and a colon for design of simple number based displays (like a clock or temperature or similar). 

The PDF file contains an overview of the layout of the fonts. 

# The current fonts with free license are available: 

* Ubuntu Fonts
* Liberation2 Fonts
* Indie Flower
* K2D
* Bitstream Vera 

# Used Software
The header files were produced with the python scripts in my git repository "TTF2BMH" and use of bmfont.
